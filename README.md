# Address Validation for Planning Center Online

This will be a simple app which, when a person is added or updated in Planning Center, will validate and update their address. It will use Planning Center's webhooks and SmartyStreets API. It requires a church to have a [personal access token with Planning Center](https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/applications) and a [SmartyStreets](http://smartystreets.com/) account (free plan is available).
